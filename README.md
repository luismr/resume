Welcome to my resume repository! This project contains my professional resume, and while contributions to improve **GitHub Actions automation** and repository workflows are welcome, **the content of the resume itself belongs to me**.

## ðŸ“„ Resume

You can view my resume in Markdown format [here](RESUME.md).

## ðŸ”’ Ownership & Usage

This resume is **my personal document**, and its content should not be altered except for **GitHub Actions automation improvements**. Any changes modifying personal details, experience, or professional background will not be accepted.

## ðŸš€ Contributing

I encourage contributions that enhance the **automation and CI/CD workflows** for generating and maintaining this resume. Possible improvements include:
- Enhancing the **GitHub Actions pipeline** for automatic PDF generation.
- Automating formatting checks or linting for Markdown files.
- Improving **workflow efficiency** for CI/CD processes.
- Adding features to automatically publish updates to a GitHub Pages site or a dedicated branch.

### ðŸ“œ GitHub Actions Workflow

This repository includes a **GitHub Actions workflow** that automatically converts `RESUME.md` into a PDF whenever changes are pushed. The workflow:
- Uses **Pandoc** and **XeLaTeX** for PDF generation.
- Automatically names the file as `RESUME-YYYY-MM-DD.pdf` based on the current date.
- Uploads the generated PDF as an artifact for easy download.

You can find the workflow configuration in `.github/workflows/convert-md-to-pdf.yml`.
